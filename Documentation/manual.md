## Using the program

### Overview

The application provides tools for managing reading tips. You can use the application to add and modify tips, browse them and search for them. You may choose to save your tips when exiting the program, in that case a file "saved_bookmarks.txt" is created and you can access your bookmarks later.

### Adding bookmarks

Type "new" (or "n") in the main menu to add a reading tip. Then the interface prompts you to add properties for the reading tip. You may choose to skip fields and some fields can have multiple parametres.

### Viewing, editing and searching bookmarks

By typing "browse" (or "b") in the main menu you can browse the added bookmarks if there are any. In the browse menu you can scroll through the bookmarks, show more information of them, edit them and search for them. 

When editing a selected bookmark you can choose a field to be replaced.

After choosing to search for bookmarks you are prompted to give tags. Bookmarks that match a tag will be shown afterwards if there are any.
